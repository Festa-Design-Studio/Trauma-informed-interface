# Dr G Lab Trauma-Informed Design System

## Overview

Dr G Lab's Trauma-Informed Design System is a comprehensive framework built to create digital experiences that prioritize user psychological safety, control, and emotional well-being. This design system implements trauma-informed principles throughout the interface while maintaining elegant design aesthetics.

## Purpose

This design system provides a complete set of UI components organized according to atomic design methodology with a focus on creating safe, predictable, and empowering user experiences. The system is built using Tailwind CSS and follows trauma-informed design principles that prioritize:

- **Safety & Predictability**: Consistent layouts, gentle transitions, and calming color palettes
- **User Control & Choice**: Content warnings, format alternatives, and explicit opt-in mechanisms
- **Clear Communication**: Supportive microcopy and consistent visual feedback
- **Emotional Support**: Check-in components, grounding exercises, and readily accessible support resources
- **Spaciousness & Calmness**: Ample white space, gentle visual elements, and careful use of color

## Key Features

- **Trauma-informed Components**: Specialized components like emergency exit buttons, content warnings, and grounding exercises
- **Semantic HTML Structure**: Accessible markup that supports assistive technologies
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with consistent breakpoints
- **Comprehensive Color System**: Carefully selected palette with semantic color mappings
- **Typography System**: Well-defined typography scale optimized for readability
